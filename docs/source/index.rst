Welcome to hexagonal's documentation!
=====================================

hexagonal is an LMS (library management system) build as a first year bachelors' project at Innopolis University.
Class diagram can be found at hexagonal.docs.hexagonal-classes.uml. Also a
:download:`rendered version <_static/BON DIAGRAM MODEL.pdf>`.

It should also be noted that as a dynamic by nature language, Python doesn't have native support for class attribute
documentation. This is also a bad practice, because it hurts readability of code.
